To create a markdown file you just need to end your file with the `.md` extension.


# Headings
 Markdown has six levels of headings. Headings in Markdown are created by putting one to six `#` in front of your heading text with a space separating the `#` and text. Each `#` represents a heading level with `#` being the largest heading and `######` being the smallest heading. Here is an example of all six heading levels.

 `# Heading 1`
 # Heading 1
 `## Heading 2`
  ## Heading 2
 `### Heading 3`
  ### Heading 3
 `#### Heading 4`
  #### Heading 4
 `##### Heading 5`
  ##### Heading 5
 `###### Heading 6`
  ###### Heading 6


# Paragraphs
Paragraphs in Markdown are the default text layout. If you just type text it will automatically be converted to a paragraph. The only important thing to know about Markdown is that if you want to seperate text into two seperate paragraphs you need to add a blank line between each set of text. If you instead just want to have a new line within your paragraph you can add two spaces at the end of the line.

# Extended markdown
One important thing to note about Markdown is that there are a lot of different variations, typically referred to as flavors. The base version of Markdown is quite a bit more limited in the formatting/styling you can do with it, but most websites that use Markdown will use some flavor which extends on Markdown. For example, GitHub uses a flavor of Markdown called GitHub Flavored Markdown which adds a lot of extra features to Markdown.

# Bold & Italics
The two most common types of text are bold and italics. These can be generated by using one `*` or `_` wrapping your text for italics or two `*` or `_` for bold.

`*This is italicized text*`  - *This is italicized text*

`_This is also italicized text_`  - _This is also italicized text_

`**This is bold text**`   - **This is bold text**

`__This is also bold text__`  - __This is also bold text__

In order to combine bold and italics you can just wrap your text in three `*` or `_` and it will be both bold and italicized.


`***This is both*** `  -  ***This is both*** 

`___This is also both___`  - ___This is also both___

it is recommended to use `*` instead of `_` since somtimes Markdown does not work well if you have `_` in the middle of a word.

# Strikethrough
Extended Markdown feature, To create strikethrough text you can wrap your text in two `~` characters.

`~~Crossed off~~`  - ~~Crossed off~~


# Highlight
 Extended Markdown feature,To highlight text you can wrap your text in two `=` characters. Unfortunately, GitHub Flavored Markdown does not support this feature but you can use HTML within Markdown (sometimes) so `<mark>` tag can be used as an replacement.

`==Highlighted==`

`<mark>Highlighted</mark>` - <mark>Highlighted</mark>


# Superscript / Subscript
To create superscript text you can wrap your text with a `^` character and to create subscript text you can wrap your text with a `~` character. This again does not work with GitHub Flavored Markdown so I have used the HTML version.

This is a `^superscript^` - ^superscript^

This is a `~subscript~` -  ~subscript~

This is a `<sup>superscript</sup>`  -   x<sup>2</sup>+2y

This is a `<sub>subscript</sub>` -  H<sub>2</sub>O


# Emoji
To add an emoji you can just type `:EMOJI_NAME:` and it will be converted to an emoji. This feature is much less widely supported does not work with GitHub Flavored Markdown, but we can just copy the emoji into your Markdown and it will work.

`:smile:`  - :smile:  
`ðŸ˜Š`  -  ðŸ˜Š

# Inline code 


To display code inline you can wrap your code in a single <code>`</code> character. This is useful for displaying small snippets of code within a paragraph.

This is `inline code` within a paragraph. - This is inline code within a paragraph.


# Code Blocks
To display a larger block of code you can wrap your code in <code>```</code> characters. You can also specify the language of your code block by adding the language name after the three characters. This will add syntax highlighting to your code block. This is an extended feature of Markdown, but nearly every Markdown flavor supports it.

```js  
// This is a code block  
const a = 1;  
``` 


# Links 
To create a link you can wrap your text in square brackets and then wrap the link in parentheses. You can even do this to make relative links. Also, if you include a URL on its own it will automatically be converted to a link in some extended Markdown flavors, otherwise you can wrap it in `<>` to make it a link.

# Images 
Images look very similar to links since they are also wrapped in square brackets and parentheses. The only difference is that you need to add an exclamation mark before the square brackets. Also, the text in the square brackets is used as the alt text for the image while the link in the parentheses is used as the source for the image.

# Blockquotes

Blockquotes are used to quote another source. To create a blockquote you can add a `>` character before your text. You can also nest blockquotes by adding multiple `>` characters.


`> This is a blockquote`  
`>> This is a nested blockquote`

> This is a blockquote
>> This is a nested blockquote
>>> This is also nested blockquote


# Horizontal Line
To add a horizontal rule you can add three or more `-` , `_`, or `*` characters on a single line.

`***`  
`---`  
`___`


# Lists 
There are two types of lists in Markdown, ordered and unordered. To create an unordered list you can add a `-`, `*`, or `+` character before each item in your list. To create an ordered list you can add a number followed by a `.` character before each item in your list. The actual order of the numbers you use does not matter. You can also nest lists by indenting them with four spaces and/or a tab.
   
```
- This is an unordered list
- Of items

1. This is an ordered list
2. The numbers do not matter
1. This says 3
    * This is a nested list
    * Of items
        1. This is a nested
        2. List of items
   
```

    * This is a nested list
    * Of items

        2. List of items




# Tables
The second to last element we will cover is tables. Tables are a bit more complicated than the other elements we have covered so far. To create a table you need to create a list of rows where each column is separated by a `|` and each row starts and ends with a `|` as well. Below the first row you need to add a row where each column consists of at least three `-`s and optionally a `:` character on either side of the `-`s. The `:` character is used to align the text in the column. If you add a `:` character on the left side of the `-`s then the text will be left aligned. If you add a `:` character on the right side of the `-`s then the text will be right aligned. If you add a `:` character on both sides of the `-`s then the text will be center aligned. Finally, you can continue to add rows to your table with the same format as your first row.
Also, this is an extended Markdown feature, but it does work with GitHub Flavored Markdown.
  ```      
| Col 1 | Col 2   |
| ----- | ------- |
| This  | is      |
| an    | example |
| table | with    |
| two   | columns |

| Right  | Center | Left |
| -----: | :----: | :--- |
| R      | C      | L    |

| Head One | Head Two |
| --- | --- |
| Does Not Need | To Be |
| Aligned | Properly |

# Checklist 
his is an extended Markdown feature, but it is supported by GitHub Flavored Markdown. To create a checklist you can add a - [ ] or - [x] before each item in your list. The - [ ] will create an unchecked checkbox while the - [x] will create a checked checkbox.


```
- [ ] Checkbox   
- [x] checked checkbox
```
